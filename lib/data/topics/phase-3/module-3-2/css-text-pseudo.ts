  "whyItMatters": "The right locator makes a browser test clearer, more reliable, and easier to maintain.",
  "notes": ":text is a Playwright selector extension. It matches text while preferring the smallest element that contains the requested text.\n\n### Try it with local HTML\n\n~~~python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.set_content(\"<button><span>Continue</span></button>\")\n    button_text = page.locator(\"button:text('Continue')\")\n    assert button_text.count() == 1\n    browser.close()\n~~~\n\nThis self-contained page keeps the example focused and repeatable.\n\n### Another example\n\n~~~python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.set_content(\"<p>Status: Ready</p>\")\n    ready = page.locator(\"p:text('Ready')\")\n    assert ready.is_visible()\n    browser.close()\n~~~\n\nChoose the locator operation that expresses the test's purpose. When a locator can match several elements, narrow it deliberately.\n\n### The takeaway\n\nUse locators that are specific and understandable. Assert the result your test needs rather than relying on page structure alone.",
  "handsOn": "Create a synchronous Playwright script.\n\n### Add this Python code\n\n~~~python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.set_content(\"<button><span>Continue</span></button>\")\n    button_text = page.locator(\"button:text('Continue')\")\n    assert button_text.count() == 1\n    browser.close()\n~~~\n\n### Run it\n\n~~~bash\npython locator_check.py\n~~~\n\n### Deliverable\n\nExplain what the locator selects and what the assertion verifies.",
  "challenge": "Create a nested element containing a short phrase. Use :text to locate it, then use get_by_role for an interactive element and compare which locator communicates intent better.",
  "proTips": [
    "Prefer a role and accessible name for user-facing controls.",
    "Use the synchronous Playwright API consistently.",
    "Use local HTML for focused, repeatable locator examples.",
    "Check locator counts when uniqueness matters."

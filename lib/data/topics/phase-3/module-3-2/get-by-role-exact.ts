  "whyItMatters": "Reliable locators make browser tests easier to understand and less dependent on page layout.",
  "notes": "Role name matching is case-insensitive and substring-based by default. Set exact=True when the complete accessible name should match.\n\n### Try it with local HTML\n\n~~~python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.set_content(\"<button>Save changes</button><button>Save</button>\")\n    assert page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Save\", exact=True).count() == 1\n    browser.close()\n~~~\n\nThe example uses a small page created in the browser, so it is self-contained.\n\n### Another example\n\n~~~python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.set_content(\"<button>Save changes</button>\")\n    assert page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Save changes\", exact=True).is_visible()\n    browser.close()\n~~~\n\nPrefer a locator that communicates the element's role or purpose. Use the options that make a locator specific enough for the intended element.\n\n### The takeaway\n\nChoose a locator that is both clear and resilient. Assert the behaviour or element state that matters to the test.",
  "handsOn": "Create a short synchronous Playwright script.\n\n### Add this Python code\n\n~~~python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch()\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.set_content(\"<button>Save changes</button><button>Save</button>\")\n    assert page.get_by_role(\"button\", name=\"Save\", exact=True).count() == 1\n    browser.close()\n~~~\n\n### Run it\n\n~~~bash\npython locator_check.py\n~~~\n\n### Deliverable\n\nExplain what the locator identifies and what the assertion verifies.",
